<P class="p9 ft5"><SPAN class="ft3">4.1</SPAN><SPAN class="ft15">The primary transactions that Purple provides Technology to support is the provision of services related to ensuring a Buyer is able to reliably operate his or her vehicle (“Reliability Services”). There are many activities that could fall within what Purple considers Reliability Services. This may include, among other things, having fuses delivered, battery charging, providing fuel for a vehicle, filling tires with air, supplying windshield wipers or supplying windshield washing fluid. Any activities that Purple provides Technology to support will be clearly identified in the Technology. You may not use the Technology to engage in any transaction other than those clearly identified in the Technology.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p18 ft7"><SPAN class="ft3">4.2</SPAN><SPAN class="ft6">When a potential Buyer is interested in engaging in a particular transaction, the Buyer will select the relevant Reliability Service in the Technology and request offers from potential Providers. Potential Providers will offer to provide the relevant Reliability Service, and the potential Buyer will receive notice of which potential Providers have offered to provide the relevant Reliability Service. The Buyer may accept an offer or reject all offers. A Buyer may not accept more than one offer. Once the Buyer accepts an offer from a Provider, a contract (the “Service Contract”) is formed between the Buyer and the Provider. Purple will continue to facilitate completing the transaction using the Technology, but Purple is not responsible for either the Buyer’s or the Provider’s ultimate performance of the Service Contract.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p4 ft17"><SPAN class="ft3">4.3</SPAN><SPAN class="ft16">Pricing for each Reliability Service supported by the Technology will be identified in the Technology before Buyer accepts an offer. Pricing is comprised of four (4) components: (a) the Reimbursable Amount; (b) the Purple Service Charge; (c) Provider Surcharges; and (d) Taxes. The total amount of these charges is referred as the “Transaction Price.”</SPAN></P>
<P class="p19 ft5"><SPAN class="ft3">(a)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft18">The Reimbursable Amount is the amount that Purple has determined, using</SPAN></P>
<P class="p20 ft19">its internal algorithms, is a reasonable amount for a Buyer to reimburse a Provider for the provision of the relevant Reliability Service. This amount can be based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, average prices in the local area, ability to access the area, the time of day and current demand for services in the area. It is unlikely that the Reimbursable Amount will be the lowest cost option for the Buyer. It is important for Users to understand that Purple’s Technology does not support transactions that use or rely on weight, measuring or counting instruments or devices or transactions that are based on the sale or delivery of any unit of weights or measures. Where quantities are at issue, Purple defines a quantity as that which Purple reasonably expects to be provided in connection with the relevant Reliability Service. For example: (i) if the Reliability Service is related to the supply and installation of two (2) new windshield wipers, then Purple expects that the Provider would deliver two (2) new windshield wipers; (ii) if the Reliability Service is related to the supply and filling of a vehicle with approximately one (1) gallon of windshield wiper fluid, then Purple expects that the Provider would deliver a single, <NOBR>pre-packaged</NOBR> one (1) gallon container of windshield wiper fluid and use that fluid to refill the vehicles windshield wiper reservoir with the full amount that the reservoir could safely hold, up to the full contents of that one (1) gallon container; or (iii) if the Reliability Service is related to a medium level of gasoline refueling service, then Purple expects that the Provider would fill two (2), six (6) gallon gasoline containers with approximately five (5) gallons of gasoline (plus or minus one half gallon (1/2) per container) each, and would fill the vehicle’s gasoline tank with as much gasoline as the tank could safely hold up to the amount in those containers. Buyer is not guaranteed a specific weight or measure of a particular product nor is Provider obligated to supply a specific weight or measure. Actual amounts delivered or supplied may vary within reasonable limits. In order for</P>

Purple will forward to Provider the funds received from Buyer for the Reimbursable Amount up to the lesser of (a) the actual quantity purchased by Provider evidenced on the receipt, and (b) the maximum quantity permitted for the applicable Reliability Service. Buyer is responsible for paying for the Reliability Service even if Provider was not able to provide this maximum quantity. The Reimbursable Amount will be set before the Service Contract is formed, and this amount (and no more) will be remitted to Provider.</P>

The amount of the Purple Service Charge will be set before the Service Contract is made. The Provider receives a portion of the Purple Service Charge, net of the fees retained by Purple.

<P class="p25 ft5"><SPAN class="ft5">(c)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft18">Provider Surcharges are those fees or surcharges that a particular Provider</SPAN></P>
<P class="p20 ft7">assesses. As discussed below, each Provider is rated, and may have certain certifications and may offer certain extras associated with providing services under the Service Contract. For example, a Provider may offer to perform Reliability Services wearing a suit and tie, but charge an additional $2.00 because of that. Because Purple serves only to facilitate transactions, Purple would like to afford Providers with the ability to be entrepreneurial, and maximize value by customizing how they offer Reliability Services. Similarly, Purple wishes to give Buyers the ability to select Reliability Services that best match their needs or desires. The amount of the Provider Surcharge will be known to the potential Buyer before an offer is accepted. The Provider Surcharge is not, and should not be considered, a tip or gratuity. Purple’s Technology does not facilitate the transfer of tips or gratuities to Providers. The full amount of the Provider Surcharge is remitted to the Provider, less specific transaction fees that may be imposed by Purple and disclosed to the Provider before the Service Contract is formed.</P>

Buyer is obligated to take all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to immediately effect the full payment irrespective of any pending dispute with a Provider. If Buyer disputes payment to a Provider, Buyer will notify Purple through the Technology promptly, but in any event no later than fifteen (15) days after the Reliability Service was performed. If Buyer uses the Technology to notify Purple of the dispute within this fifteen (15) day period, Purple will not remit any payment to Provider until Purple receives satisfactory evidence from Buyer and Provider that the dispute is resolved and Purple has received instructions for the distribution. If such a dispute is not resolved within ninety (90) days, Purple may, but is not obligated to, release the funds, net of the Purple Service Charge and any applicable Taxes, back to Buyer.
