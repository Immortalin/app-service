</p>
<p>
    4. Transaction Matching
</p>
<p>
    4.1 The primary transactions that Purple provides Technology to support is the provision of services related to ensuring a Buyer is able to reliably operate his or her vehicle (“Reliability Services”). There are many activities that could fall within what Purple considers Reliability Services. This may include, among other things, having fuses delivered, battery charging, providing fuel for a vehicle, filling tires with air, supplying windshield wipers or supplying windshield washing fluid. Any activities that Purple provides Technology to support will be clearly identified in the Technology. You may not use the Technology to engage in any transaction other than those clearly identified in the Technology.
</p>
<p>
    4.2 When a potential Buyer is interested in engaging in a particular transaction, the Buyer will select the relevant Reliability Service in the Technology and request offers from potential Providers. Potential Providers will offer to provide the relevant Reliability Service, and the potential Buyer will receive notice of which potential Providers have offered to provide the relevant Reliability Service. The Buyer may accept an offer or reject all offers. A Buyer may not accept more than one offer. Once the Buyer accepts an offer from a Provider, a contract (the “Service Contract”) is formed between the Buyer and the Provider. Purple will continue to facilitate completing the transaction using the Technology, but Purple is not responsible for either the Buyer’s or the Provider’s ultimate performance of the Service Contract.
</p>
<p>
    4.3 Pricing for each Reliability Service supported by the Technology will be identified in the Technology before Buyer accepts an offer. Pricing is comprised of four (4) components: (a) the Reimbursable Amount; (b) the Purple Service Charge; (c) Provider Surcharges; and (d) Taxes. The total amount of these charges is referred as the “Transaction Price.”
</p>
<p>
    (a) The Reimbursable Amount is the amount that Purple has determined, using its internal algorithms, is a reasonable amount for a Buyer to reimburse a Provider for the provision of the relevant Reliability Service. This amount can be based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, average prices in the local area, ability to access the area, the time of day and current demand for services in the area. It is unlikely that the Reimbursable Amount will be the lowest cost option for the Buyer. It is important for Users to understand that Purple’s Technology does not support transactions that use or rely on weight, measuring or counting instruments or devices or transactions that are based on the sale or delivery of any unit of weights or measures. Where quantities are at issue, Purple defines a quantity as that which Purple reasonably expects to be provided in connection with the relevant Reliability Service. For example: (i) if the Reliability Service is related to the supply and installation of two (2) new windshield wipers, then Purple expects that the Provider would deliver two (2) new windshield wipers; (ii) if the Reliability Service is related to the supply and filling of a vehicle with approximately one (1) gallon of windshield wiper fluid, then Purple expects that the Provider would deliver a single, pre-packaged one (1) gallon container of windshield wiper fluid and use that fluid to refill the vehicles windshield wiper reservoir with the full amount that the reservoir could safely hold, up to the full contents of that one (1) gallon container; or (iii) if the Reliability Service is related to a medium level of gasoline refueling service, then Purple expects that the Provider would fill two (2), six (6) gallon gasoline containers with approximately five (5) gallons of gasoline (plus or minus one half gallon (1/2) per container) each, and would fill the vehicle’s gasoline tank with as much gasoline as the tank could safely hold up to the amount in those containers. Buyer is not guaranteed a specific weight or measure of a particular product nor is Provider obligated to supply a specific weight or measure. Actual amounts delivered or supplied may vary within reasonable limits. In order for
</p>
<p>
    Providers to be reimbursed for any Reimbursable Amount, they are required to deliver to Purple a receipt evidencing the quantity purchased. Purple will forward to Provider the funds received from Buyer for the Reimbursable Amount up to the lesser of (a) the actual quantity purchased by Provider evidenced on the receipt, and (b) the maximum quantity permitted for the applicable Reliability Service. Buyer is responsible for paying for the Reliability Service even if Provider was not able to provide this maximum quantity. The Reimbursable Amount will be set before the Service Contract is formed, and this amount (and no more) will be remitted to Provider.
</p>
<p>
    (b) The Purple Service Charge is the charge Purple assesses for use of the Technology. This charge is set by Purple in its sole discretion and may be changed at any time and from time to time by Purple. The amount of the Purple Service Charge will be set before the Service Contract is made. The Provider receives a portion of the Purple Service Charge, net of the fees retained by Purple. Providers will know the fees charged by Purple before they submit an offer to provide Reliability Services to a potential Buyer.
</p>
<p>
    (c) Provider Surcharges are those fees or surcharges that a particular Provider assesses. As discussed below, each Provider is rated, and may have certain certifications and may offer certain extras associated with providing services under the Service Contract. For example, a Provider may offer to perform Reliability Services wearing a suit and tie, but charge an additional $2.00 because of that. Because Purple serves only to facilitate transactions, Purple would like to afford Providers with the ability to be entrepreneurial, and maximize value by customizing how they offer Reliability Services. Similarly, Purple wishes to give Buyers the ability to select Reliability Services that best match their needs or desires. The amount of the Provider Surcharge will be known to the potential Buyer before an offer is accepted. The Provider Surcharge is not, and should not be considered, a tip or gratuity. Purple’s Technology does not facilitate the transfer of tips or gratuities to Providers. The full amount of the Provider Surcharge is remitted to the Provider, less specific transaction fees that may be imposed by Purple and disclosed to the Provider before the Service Contract is formed.
</p>
<p>
    (d) Taxes are any taxes or other charges that Purple is obligated or has elected to collect in support of the transaction. To the extent that any Taxes are collected by Purple, the amount of those Taxes will be known to Buyer before accepting an offer and the amount will be remitted as required by applicable law.
</p>
<p>
    4.4 Once a Service Contract is formed between a Buyer and a Provider, Buyer is obligated to pay the Transaction Price, and Provider is obligated to perform the applicable Reliability Service. Each of Buyer and Provider agree that their Service Contract is subject to the terms and conditions set forth below under “Service Contract Terms”.
</p>
<p>
    4.5 Once a Service Contract is formed, Buyer may not cancel the Reliability Service unless the Provider consents to cancellation and both Users have notified Purple through the Technology that the Reliability Service was cancelled. Provider must notify Buyer and Purple through the Technology once the Reliability Service is complete. If Provider is unable to complete the Reliability Service for any reason, Provider must notify Buyer and Purple to this effect through the Technology.
</p>
<p>
    5. Payment
</p>
<p>
    5.1 Upon completion of the Reliability Service under a Service Contract, Buyer will pay to Purple the full Transaction Price. Buyer agrees to pay all charges incurred on his or her credit card, debit card, or other payment method set up in the Buyer’s account. If for any reason, Purple is unable to process the payment, Purple will notify Buyer and Provider to this effect through the Technology. Buyer is obligated to take all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to immediately effect the full payment irrespective of any pending dispute with a Provider. If Buyer disputes payment to a Provider, Buyer will notify Purple through the Technology promptly, but in any event no later than fifteen (15) days after the Reliability Service was performed. If Buyer uses the Technology to notify Purple of the dispute within this fifteen (15) day period, Purple will not remit any payment to Provider until Purple receives satisfactory evidence from Buyer and Provider that the dispute is resolved and Purple has received instructions for the distribution. If such a dispute is not resolved within ninety (90) days, Purple may, but is not obligated to, release the funds, net of the Purple Service Charge and any applicable Taxes, back to Buyer. Purple is not responsible for the release or recovery of any funds distributed to a Provider associated with a dispute that Purple receives notice of more than fifteen (15) days after the Reliability Service was completed.
</p>
<p>
    5.2 Purple will facilitate all payments through a third party payment processing service. Buyer and Provider each consent to the use of the third party payment processing service selected by Purple and acknowledge that such service provider may change from time to time.
</p>
<p>
    5.3 Purple will remit the amounts owed to Provider for the applicable Reliability Service within thirty (30) days after receipt of funds from Buyer. Provider will receive its total net disbursement once per month. Purple currently makes disbursements on one (1) specific day of the month, which day may change from time to time and if such day is a weekend or holiday, Purple will make the distribution on the first business day after such day.
</p>
<p>
    6. Service Contract Terms
</p>
<p>
    6.1 The terms and conditions set forth in this Section 6 set forth the terms and conditions of the Service Contract pursuant which Buyer has agreed to purchase Reliability Services from Provider and under which Provider has agreed to perform such Reliability Services. Purple is not a party to the Service Contract, but is a third party beneficiary of the Service Contract.
</p>
<p>
    6.2 Using the Technology, Provider has offered to provide certain Reliability Services to Buyer and Buyer has agreed to purchase the Reliability Services. The Reliability Services and the Transaction Price are all as defined through the use of the Technology and as recorded by Purple using the Technology.
</p>
<p>
    6.3 Provider will perform the Reliability Services in a reasonable and prudent manner, in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Provider will take all reasonable precautions to ensure the Reliability Services are performed safely, with due care to protect the environment and Buyer’s property. Provider is responsible for knowing the applicable laws, rules and regulations and obtaining any necessary or appropriate permits. Provider is responsible for providing any and all equipment, goods, materials and services necessary or appropriate to perform the Reliability Services.
</p>
<p>
    6.4 Buyer will pay for performance of the Reliability Services. Buyer is responsible for ensuring that the vehicle is accessible and available to be safely serviced. This includes ensuring that any tanks or reservoirs are accessible by Provider, such as leaving the fuel tank open, and that any security measures will not prevent Provider from accessing the vehicle. If Provider is unable to complete the Reliability Service through no fault of Provider, Buyer is still obligated to pay the Transaction Price.
</p>
<p>
    6.5 Provider will notify Buyer through the Technology before starting to perform the Reliability Service and, if requested by Buyer, provide Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to be present during performance of the Reliability Service. Provider will notify Buyer through the Technology once the Reliability Service is complete. Buyer will receive a receipt for the Reliability Service through the Technology and agrees that this electronic receipt is sufficient for all purposes, including any specific requirements under applicable law. If Buyer wishes to receive a paper receipt, and Buyer is obligated to provide such a receipt under applicable law, Buyer must notify Provider to this effect before the Reliability Service is performed and must be present to receive the paper receipt upon completion of the Reliability Service.
</p>
<p>
    6.6 Provider is responsible to Buyer, and will hold Buyer harmless from, any and all claims, losses, damages, fines or penalties arising from use of the Technology or performance of the Reliability Service by Provider, except to the extent resulting from the acts or omissions of Buyer. Buyer is responsible to Provider, and will hold Provider harmless from, any and all claims, losses, damages, fines or penalties arising from the use of the Technology or purchase of the Reliability Service from Provider except to the extent resulting from the acts or omissions of Provider.
</p>
<p>
    6.7 Buyer and Provider each agree to process payment for the Reliability Services through the Technology in accordance with these Terms of Use.
</p>
<p>
    6.8 BUYER UNDERSTAND AND AGREES THAT THE RELIABILITY SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, PROVIDER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
</p>
<p>
    6.9 BUYER AND PROVIDER EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT EACH WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, COMPENSATORY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES) RESULTING FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE OBLIGATIONS OF THIS SERVICE CONTRACT). THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
</p>
<p>
    6.10 The construction and performance of this Service Contract shall be governed by the laws of the state in which the Reliability Services were performed without regard to its principles of conflicts of law. Each of Buyer and Provider irrevocably consents and agrees that any legal action or proceedings brought to enforce this Service Contract will be brought in the United States
</p>
<p>
    or California state courts located in the jurisdiction where the Reliability Services were performed and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceedings with respect hereto brought in any such court, and further irrevocably waives to the fullest extent permitted by law any claim that any such suit, action or proceedings brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
</p>
<p>
    6.11 No delay or omission by Buyer or Provider in exercising any right or remedy provided for herein will constitute a waiver of such right or remedy nor will it be construed as a bar to or waiver of any such right or remedy on any future occasion. This Service Contract contains the entire understanding of Buyer and Provider with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous discussions, agreements and commitments between Buyer and Provider with respect hereto and thereto. There are no agreements or understandings between Buyer and Provider respecting the subject matter hereof or thereof, whether oral or written, other than those set forth herein or therein, and neither Buyer nor Provider has relied upon any representation, express or implied, not contained in this Service Contract. Provider is an independent contractor and nothing contained herein will be construed as constituting any relationship with Buyer other than that of purchaser and independent contractor, nor will it be construed as creating any relationship whatsoever between Buyer and Provider, including employer/employee, partners or joint venture parties. The invalidity of one or more phrases, sentences, clauses or sections of this Service Contract will not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Service Contract so long as the material purposes of this Service Contract can be determined and effectuated, and the invalid provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted in a manner that mostly closely effectuates the intent by Buyer and Provider.
</p>
<p>
    7. Providers
</p>
<p>
    7.1 Provider understands and agrees that Provider is required to perform Provider’s Reliability Services in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Provider is responsible for knowing the laws, rules and regulations applicable in the areas in which Provider offers to provide Reliability Services.
</p>
<p>
    7.2 Provider understands and agrees that Provider is required to supply all of Provider’s own equipment, materials and products necessary to perform the Reliability Services that Provider offers. Purple may, but is not required to, make available for purchase or use, equipment, materials or products that will facilitate the provision of certain Reliability Services. Provider may elect, in its sole discretion, to use any such equipment, materials or products. PURPLE MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO SUCH EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS OR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE USE OF SUCH EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS OR PRODUCTS IS PERMITTED WITHIN THE AREA THAT YOU OPERATE, WHETHER IT COMPLIES WITH ANY APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS, OR WHETHER IT IS FIT FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Provider’s use of any such equipment, materials or products will be further subject to additional terms and conditions entered into between Provider and Purple regarding such equipment, materials or products.
</p>
<p>
    7.3 Provider understands and agrees that Provider’s will only be reimbursed by a Buyer for the Reimbursable Amount. To the extent Provider is able to produce equipment, materials or products that are subject to reimbursement at a cost that exceeds the Reimbursable Amount, Provider will be responsible for any such excess. To the extent Provider is able to produce equipment, materials or products that are subject to reimbursement at a cost that is less than the Reimbursable Amount, Provider is entitled to retain such excess.
</p>
<p>
    7.4 Provider understands and agrees that Provider must maintain insurance as is reasonable, necessary and appropriate in performing the Reliability Services. Purple will maintain insurance as described in Section 10 of these Terms and Uses, and Provider will be named as an additional insured on certain policies as discussed Section 10 of these Terms and Uses. There is no guarantee, however, that this insurance will be sufficient to cover Provider’s liability. As a result, Provider must maintain insurance that Provider believes is reasonable, necessary or appropriate to insure Provider against risks and liabilities.
</p>
<p>
    7.5 Provider understands and agrees that Provider is not an employee or agent of Purple or any Buyer. Provider operates as an independent contractor providing services directly to Buyer. Provider is responsible to Buyer for Provider’s conduct. Provider’s use of the Technology may be suspended by Purple acting reasonably and in good faith for any number of reasons. These reasons include, but are not limited to, (i) any violation of these Terms of Use, (ii) the use of the Technology to perform any illegal activities, (iii) using the Technology to make any misrepresentations to Buyers, (iv) excessive complaints from Buyers regarding the provision of Reliability Services, (v) claims made under Purple’s insurance policies that materially increase our cost to maintain insurance, (vi) the use of the Technology or any information you obtain using the Technology (including Buyer names and contact information) to benefit any of Purple’s competitors, and (vii) improper use of information obtained through your other activities that implicates how you use the Technology.
</p>
<p>
    7.6 Each Provider represents and warrants to Purple the following: (a) Provider is at least twenty one (21) years of age; (b) Provider possesses a valid driver’s license, is authorized to operate a motor vehicle, and has all appropriate licenses, approvals and authority to provide the Reliability Services offered using the Technology; (c) Provider is named or scheduled on the insurance policy covering Provider and the vehicle Provider uses in performing the Reliability Services; (d) Provider has a valid policy of personal or commercial liability insurance (in coverage amounts consistent with all applicable state or federal legal requirements) for the operation of such Provider’s vehicle to cover any anticipated losses related to Provider’s provision of the Reliability Services; (e) Provider will be solely responsible for any and all liability which results from or is alleged as a result of the provision of Reliability Services, including, but not limited to personal injuries, death and property damages; and (f) Provider will be solely responsible for any violations of applicable laws, rules or regulations.
</p>
<p>
    7.7 Provider is solely responsible for having and maintaining any and all necessary or appropriate knowledge and training to perform the Reliability Services that Provider offers. Purple may, from time to time, offer to provide or make available for use training, equipment or protocols that Purple believes are reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with performing certain Reliability Services. Provider understand and agrees that the use of any such training, equipment or protocols is entirely voluntary and the use of such training, equipment or protocols is at
</p>
<p>
    Provider’s own risk. Purple makes no representation or warranty that any such training, equipment or protocols are complete or adequate to cover all potential risks or legal requirements associated with performing any particular Reliability Service.
</p>
<p>
    8. Ratings
</p>
<p>
    8.1 In order to facilitate Transaction matching, Purple allows Buyers and Providers to rate each other in connection with their respective performance of obligations in connection with performing any particular Transaction. In connection with using this rating system, you acknowledge and agree that: (a) all of your reviews and ratings will either be based upon your actual first-hand experience with Buyer or Provider (as applicable) and the particular Transaction that you are reviewing; (b) all of your reviews and ratings will be accurate, truthful and complete in all respects; (c) your name and review information will be made available to the Buyers or Providers (as applicable) that you review; (d) you will not submit any reviews that may be considered by Purple to be unlawful, harassing, libelous, abusive, threatening, obscene, profane, hateful, offensive, harmful, vulgar, distasteful, defamatory, invasive of another person’s privacy or proprietary rights, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable; (e) you will submit thorough and thoughtful reviews of Buyers or Providers; and (f) you will not impersonate, or attempt to impersonate, any other person, falsify contact information, misrepresent a relationship with any person or entity, including misrepresenting a relationship with Purple, or otherwise attempt to mislead others as to the identity of the sender or the origin of a review or rating.
</p>
<p>
    8.2 The reviews and ratings that you provide do not reflect the views of Purple. Purple does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any Provider or Buyer. Purple is not responsible or liable, indirectly or directly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with transacting with any Provider or Buyer. Your dealings with, and any other terms, conditions, representations or warranties associated with such dealings, are between Buyer and Provider, exclusively, and do not involve Purple. You should make whatever investigation or other resources that you deem necessary or appropriate before hiring or engaging with a particular Buyer or Provider.
</p>
<p>
    8.3 You agree that Purple is not responsible for your interactions and dealings with a particular Buyer or Provider. You waive the right to bring or assert any claim against Purple relating to any interactions or dealings with any Buyer or Provider. You release Purple from any and all liability for or relating to any interactions or dealings with any Buyer or Provider.
</p>
<p>
    8.4 Purple may, in its sole discretion, have criminal and/or financial background checks conducted on certain Providers. BY HAVING SUCH BACKGROUND CHECKS CONDUCTED, PURPLE DOES NOT WAIVE ANY OF ITS DISCLAIMER OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.
</p>
<p>
    9. Complaints
</p>
<p>
    9.1 If there is a dispute between a Buyer and Provider, either may request Purple’s assistance in communicating between them about the dispute and informal assistance in resolving the dispute (“Dispute Assistance”).
</p>
<p>
    9.2 If you request Purple’s Dispute Assistance, you will notify Purple through the Technology and Purple will respond to your request. Purple will facilitate communication between Buyer and Provider.
</p>
<p>
    9.3 Your participation in Dispute Assistance is entirely voluntary. Purple reserves the right to elect to reject your request to participate in Dispute Assistance for any reason.
</p>
<p>
    9.4 Dispute Assistance is not a legal forum and Purple does not, at any time, become a party to your dispute. Purple is not a mediator or an arbitrator and does not provide legal advice or assistance. If you believe legal services are necessary or would be helpful to resolve your dispute, Purple encourages you to consult with an attorney. Purple does not guarantee that Dispute Assistance will result in a satisfactory outcome or your desired resolution. You agree that, by offering the Dispute Assistance, Purple does not waive any of its disclaimers or limitations of liability.
</p>
<p>
    10. Insurance
</p>
<p>
    10.1 Purple provides a one million dollar ($1,000,000) per incident commercial liability insurance that protects Providers for bodily injury, physical property damage and pollution liability claims in the event that the Provider’s personal insurance is inadequate or denied. Coverage begins when the Buyer accepts a Provider’s offer to provide Reliability Services through the Technology and ends when the Provider completes or terminates performance of the Reliability Services. Completion or termination of the Reliability Services is conclusively demonstrated through the notifications issued through the Technology, but may occur at an earlier time if there is a delay in issuing this notice. This insurance coverage is limited to liability only and does not provide coverage for collision, comprehensive, or wear and tear damage to a Provider’s vehicle. Purple’s coverage is secondary to any other valid and applicable insurance policies that may be held by the Provider, and will apply when all coverages from other such insurance policies have been fully exhausted or declined.
</p>
<p>
    10.2 We want to remind you that your personal insurance policies may not cover you while you are providing or receiving Reliability Services.
</p>
<p>
    10.3 Purple is not directly responsible for damage, theft, pollution discharges or other liabilities; our policies are in place as a service to Buyers and Providers. Maintaining such policies does not operate to modify, limit or waive any waivers or limits of liability set forth in these Terms of Use.
</p>
<p>
    10.4 Additional insurance terms, limitations, and exclusions apply. Users with claims should submit such a claim to Purple promptly. Users with claims agree to cooperate with Purple to provide required information sufficient to investigate the claim. Failure to cooperate may result in claims being denied by Purple’s insurance company.
</p>
